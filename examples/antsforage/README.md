# Rust AntsForaging
A simple implementation of the Ants Foraging simulation, fully based on the RustAB framework.

# How to run
Simply run `cargo run --example antsforage`, or add the `--release` flag for a slower to compile, faster to execute option.

# What to expect
The simulation will run and notify when the food source is found for the first time by ants.
Once an ant returns to the nest with food for the first time, it is notified and the simulation stops successfully.
