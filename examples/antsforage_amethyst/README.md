An initial attempt at implementing the ants forage simulation, with a visualization of it as well.

# How to run
Simply run `cargo run --example antsforage_amethyst`, or add the `--release` flag for a slower to compile, faster to execute option.

# Current issues
- [x] Obstacles are not implemented yet; Implemented on 18/10/2020
- [x] Pheromones lack some sort of visualization; Implemented on 18/10/2020
- [ ] Pheromones do not evaporate over time.
